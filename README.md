[![Setup Jikkou](https://github.com/streamthoughts/setup-jikkou/actions/workflows/setup-jikkou.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/streamthoughts/setup-jikkou/actions/workflows/setup-jikkou.yml)

**[Jikkou (jikk≈ç / ÂÆüË°å)](https://github.com/streamthoughts/jikkou)** is an open-source tool designed to provide an efficient and easy way to manage, automate, and
provision resource configurations for Kafka, Schema Registry, etc.

The `streamthoughts/setup-jikkou` action is a JavaScript action that sets
up [Jikkou CLI](https://github.com/streamthoughts/jikkou) in your **GitHub Actions**
workflow by:

* Downloading a specific version of **Jikkou CLI** and adding it to the `PATH`.
* Configuring **JIKKOU CLI** with a custom configuration file and automatically setting up the `JIKKOUCONFIG`
  environment variable.
* Installing a **wrapper script** to wrap calls of the Jikkou CLI binary to expose its `STDOUT`, `STDERR`,
  and exit code as outputs named `stdout`, `stderr`, and `exitcode` respectively.

After you've used the action, subsequent steps in the same job can run arbitrary Jikkou commands using the GitHub
Actions run syntax. This allows most Jikkou commands to work exactly like they do on your local command line.

## Usages

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: streamthoughts/setup-jikkou@v1
```

A specific version of Jikkou CLI can be installed:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: streamthoughts/setup-jikkou@v0.1.0
    with:
      jikkou_version: 0.28.0
```

A custom configuration file can be specified:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: streamthoughts/setup-jikkou@v0.1.0
    with:
      jikkou_config: ./config/jikkouconfig.json
```
